```
Checks if your Tesla profile has changed from a reservation number to something else

-- Python 3.6 or later required

Run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Edit config.ini and put in all the required settings

There will be a log file called 'teslascrub.log' in the same directory as the script.

Setting DEBUG to 'yes' may end up logging some private information in the log file. SANITIZE BEFORE SHARING!

Enjoy or whatever!
